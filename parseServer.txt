Connecting to Your Linux Instance from Windows Using PuTTY

After you launch your instance, you can connect to it and use it the way that you'd use a computer sitting in front of you.

Note
After you launch an instance, it can take a few minutes for the instance to be ready so that you can connect to it. Check that your instance has passed its status checks - you can view this information in the Status Checks column on the Instances page.
The following instructions explain how to connect to your instance using PuTTY, a free SSH client for Windows. If you receive an error while attempting to connect to your instance, see Troubleshooting Connecting to Your Instance.

Prerequisites

Before you connect to your Linux instance using PuTTY, complete the following prerequisites:

Install PuTTY
Download and install PuTTY from the PuTTY download page. If you already have an older version of PuTTY installed, we recommend that you download the latest version. Be sure to install the entire suite.
Get the ID of the instance
You can get the ID of your instance using the Amazon EC2 console (from the Instance ID column). If you prefer, you can use the describe-instances (AWS CLI) or Get-EC2Instance (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell) command.
Get the public DNS name of the instance
You can get the public DNS for your instance using the Amazon EC2 console (check the Public DNS (IPv4) column; if this column is hidden, choose the Show/Hide icon and select Public DNS (IPv4)). If you prefer, you can use the describe-instances (AWS CLI) or Get-EC2Instance (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell) command.
(IPv6 only) Get the IPv6 address of the instance
If you've assigned an IPv6 address to your instance, you can optionally connect to the instance using its IPv6 address instead of a public IPv4 address or public IPv4 DNS hostname. Your local computer must have an IPv6 address and must be configured to use IPv6. You can get the IPv6 address of your instance using the Amazon EC2 console (check the IPv6 IPs field). If you prefer, you can use the describe-instances (AWS CLI) or Get-EC2Instance (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell) command. For more information about IPv6, see IPv6 Addresses.
Locate the private key
Get the fully qualified path to the location on your computer of the .pem file for the key pair that you specified when you launched the instance.
Enable inbound SSH traffic from your IP address to your instance
Ensure that the security group associated with your instance allows incoming SSH traffic from your IP address. The default security group does not allow incoming SSH traffic by default. For more information, see Authorizing Inbound Traffic for Your Linux Instances.
Converting Your Private Key Using PuTTYgen

PuTTY does not natively support the private key format (.pem) generated by Amazon EC2. PuTTY has a tool named PuTTYgen, which can convert keys to the required PuTTY format (.ppk). You must convert your private key into this format (.ppk) before attempting to connect to your instance using PuTTY.

To convert your private key

Start PuTTYgen (for example, from the Start menu, choose All Programs > PuTTY > PuTTYgen).

Under Type of key to generate, choose RSA key in PuTTYgen
						
If you're using an older version of PuTTYgen, choose SSH-2 RSA.

Choose Load. By default, PuTTYgen displays only files with the extension .ppk. To locate your .pem file, select the option to display files of all types.

Select all file types						
Select your .pem file for the key pair that you specified when you launch your instance, and then choose Open. Choose OK to dismiss the confirmation dialog box.

Choose Save private key to save the key in the format that PuTTY can use. PuTTYgen displays a warning about saving the key without a passphrase. Choose Yes.

Note
A passphrase on a private key is an extra layer of protection, so even if your private key is discovered, it can't be used without the passphrase. The downside to using a passphrase is that it makes automation harder because human intervention is needed to log on to an instance, or copy files to an instance.
Specify the same name for the key that you used for the key pair (for example, my-key-pair). PuTTY automatically adds the .ppk file extension.
Your private key is now in the correct format for use with PuTTY. You can now connect to your instance using PuTTY's SSH client.

Starting a PuTTY Session

Use the following procedure to connect to your Linux instance using PuTTY. You need the .ppk file that you created for your private key. If you receive an error while attempting to connect to your instance, see Troubleshooting Connecting to Your Instance.

To start a PuTTY session

(Optional) You can verify the RSA key fingerprint on your instance using the get-console-output (AWS CLI) command on your local system (not on the instance). This is useful if you've launched your instance from a public AMI from a third party. Locate the SSH HOST KEY FINGERPRINTS section, and note the RSA fingerprint (for example, 1f:51:ae:28:bf:89:e9:d8:1f:25:5d:37:2d:7d:b8:ca:9f:f5:f1:6f) and compare it to the fingerprint of the instance.

Copy
aws ec2 get-console-output --instance-id instance_id
Here is an example of what you should look for:

-----BEGIN SSH HOST KEY FINGERPRINTS-----
... 1f:51:ae:28:bf:89:e9:d8:1f:25:5d:37:2d:7d:b8:ca:9f:f5:f1:6f ...
-----END SSH HOST KEY FINGERPRINTS-----
Note that the SSH HOST KEY FINGERPRINTS section is only available after the first boot of the instance.

Start PuTTY (from the Start menu, choose All Programs > PuTTY > PuTTY).

In the Category pane, select Session and complete the following fields:

In the Host Name box, enter user_name@public_dns_name. Be sure to specify the appropriate user name for your AMI. For example:

For an Amazon Linux AMI, the user name is ec2-user.
For a RHEL AMI, the user name is ec2-user or root.
For an Ubuntu AMI, the user name is ubuntu or root.
For a Centos AMI, the user name is centos.
For a Fedora AMI, the user name is ec2-user.
For SUSE, the user name is ec2-user or root.
Otherwise, if ec2-user and root don't work, check with the AMI provider.
(IPv6 only) To connect using your instance's IPv6 address, enter user_name@ipv6_address. Be sure to specify the appropriate user name for your AMI. For example:

For an Amazon Linux AMI, the user name is ec2-user.
For a RHEL AMI, the user name is ec2-user or root.
For an Ubuntu AMI, the user name is ubuntu or root.
For a Centos AMI, the user name is centos.
For a Fedora AMI, the user name is ec2-user.
For SUSE, the user name is ec2-user or root.
Otherwise, if ec2-user and root don't work, check with the AMI provider.
Under Connection type, select SSH.

Ensure that Port is 22.
PuTTY configuration - Session
						
In the Category pane, expand Connection, expand SSH, and then select Auth. Complete the following:

Choose Browse.

Select the .ppk file that you generated for your key pair, and then choose Open.

(Optional) If you plan to start this session again later, you can save the session information for future use. Select Session in the Category tree, enter a name for the session in Saved Sessions, and then choose Save.

Choose Open to start the PuTTY session.

PuTTY configuration - Auth
						
If this is the first time you have connected to this instance, PuTTY displays a security alert dialog box that asks whether you trust the host you are connecting to.

(Optional) Verify that the fingerprint in the security alert dialog box matches the fingerprint that you previously obtained in step 1. If these fingerprints don't match, someone might be attempting a "man-in-the-middle" attack. If they match, continue to the next step.

Choose Yes. A window opens and you are connected to your instance.

//////////ANONYMOUS USER ON PARSE SERVER////////////
https://dzone.com/articles/parsecom-anonymous-and

Enabling anonymous access
To enable your Parse.com app for using anonymous access, you have to do the following:

1. Enable anonymous access in the Parse.com console. Go to Settings -> Authentication and enable "Allow anonymous access".

2. Add the following code in the onCreate method of your Android Application class:

@Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        Parse.initialize(this, "APPLICATION_ID", "CLIENT_KEY");
        ParseUser.enableAutomaticUser();
}

By enabling automatic user, the call to ParseUser.getCurrentUser() always returns a user and thus is never null. You can check if the user is an anonymous user or a registered one by using the following code:

ParseAnonymousUtils.isLinked(ParseUser.getCurrentUser());
This can be useful to check if the sign-up button should be displayed or disabling some functionality which is only accessible to registered users.

Converting an anonymous user into a registered one
An anonymous user can be converted to a registered one. The data belonging to the anonymous user is also present on the registered one.

Before converting an anonymous user, there are some things to consider:


The username can not be left blank. You must explicitly specify a username and password on the user which is to be converted into a registered one.
It is adviced to save the anonymous user to the backend as soon as it is created. If this is not done and a call to saveInBackground is called on the registered user (after converting it from an anonymous one) a stack overflow is generated from the Android parse SDK. See also the following question on Stack-overflow (created by me): http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27595057/converting-an-anonymous-user-to-a-regular-user-and-saving
To save the user immediately after it is created, modify the Application code so that it looks like this:
@Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        Parse.initialize(this, "APPLICATION_ID", "CLIENT_KEY");
        ParseUser.enableAutomaticUser();
        ParseUser.getCurrentUser.saveInBackground();
}

The anonymous user can now be converted into a registered one with the following code:
findViewById(R.id.createUser).setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(final View v) {
                final String accountUsername = username.getText().toString();
                final String accountPassword = password.getText().toString();
                final ParseUser user = ParseUser.getCurrentUser();
                user.setUsername(accountUsername);
                user.setPassword(accountPassword);
                user.signUpInBackground(new SignUpCallback() {
                    @Override
                    public void done(final ParseException e) {
                        if (e != null) {
                            Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, "Signup Fail", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
                            Log.e(TAG, "Signup fail", e);
                        } else {
                            Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, "Signup success", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
                            final ParseUser user = ParseUser.getCurrentUser();
                            user.put("phone_no", "31612345678");
                            user.saveInBackground(new SaveCallback() {
                                @Override
                                public void done(final ParseException e) {
                                    if (e != null) {
                                        Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, "Save data Fail", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
                                        Log.e(TAG, "Signup fail", e);
                                    } else {
                                        Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, "Save data success", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
                                    }
                                }
                            });
                        }
                    }
                });
            }
        })

Please note that the data associated with the user in the saveInBackground call (after sign-up is successful) could also be associated immediately to the user before the signUp call. This saves an extra network call. The call to saveInBackground is pure for demonstration purposes.
