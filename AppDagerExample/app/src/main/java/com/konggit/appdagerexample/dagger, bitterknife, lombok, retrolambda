Retrolambda++++++++++++++++++++++
lets you run Java 8 code with lambda expressions, method references and try-with-resources
statements on Java 7, 6 or 5. It does this by transforming your Java 8 compiled bytecode so that
it can run on an older Java runtime. After the transformation they are just a bunch of normal
.class files, without any additional runtime dependencies. Read more details.

There is also limited support for backporting default methods and static methods on interfaces.
This feature is disabled by default.

Retrolambda supports backporting to Java 7, Java 6 and Java 5 runtimes. And for adventurous
developers there are other backporting tools that may let you go from Java 5 down to Java 1.4.

Android developers may use Retrolambda to take advantage of the Java 8 features on Android.
Serge Zaitsev has written an article about it and there is a Gradle plugin which makes it easy.

Retrolambda does not backport the new Java 8 APIs, but there are other projects that have backported
some of them:



Project Lombok++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Project Lombok is a java library that automatically plugs into your editor and build tools, spicing
up your java.
Never write another getter or equals method again. Early access to future java features such as val,
and much more.



Butter Knife+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Field and method binding for Android views
Javadoc · StackOverflow

Introduction
Annotate fields with @BindView and a view ID for Butter Knife to find and automatically cast the
corresponding view in your layout.

class ExampleActivity extends Activity {
  @BindView(R.id.title) TextView title;
  @BindView(R.id.subtitle) TextView subtitle;
  @BindView(R.id.footer) TextView footer;

  @Override public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.simple_activity);
    ButterKnife.bind(this);
    // TODO Use fields...
  }
}
Instead of slow reflection, code is generated to perform the view look-ups. Calling bind delegates
to this generated code that you can see and debug.

The generated code for the above example is roughly equivalent to the following:

public void bind(ExampleActivity activity) {
  activity.subtitle = (android.widget.TextView) activity.findViewById(2130968578);
  activity.footer = (android.widget.TextView) activity.findViewById(2130968579);
  activity.title = (android.widget.TextView) activity.findViewById(2130968577);
}
RESOURCE BINDING
Bind pre-defined resources with @BindBool, @BindColor, @BindDimen, @BindDrawable, @BindInt,
@BindString, which binds an R.bool ID (or your specified type) to its corresponding field.

class ExampleActivity extends Activity {
  @BindString(R.string.title) String title;
  @BindDrawable(R.drawable.graphic) Drawable graphic;
  @BindColor(R.color.red) int red; // int or ColorStateList field
  @BindDimen(R.dimen.spacer) Float spacer; // int (for pixel size) or float (for exact value) field
  // ...
}
NON-ACTIVITY BINDING
You can also perform binding on arbitrary objects by supplying your own view root.

public class FancyFragment extends Fragment {
  @BindView(R.id.button1) Button button1;
  @BindView(R.id.button2) Button button2;

  @Override public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,
  Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    View view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fancy_fragment, container, false);
    ButterKnife.bind(this, view);
    // TODO Use fields...
    return view;
  }
}
Another use is simplifying the view holder pattern inside of a list adapter.

public class MyAdapter extends BaseAdapter {
  @Override public View getView(int position, View view, ViewGroup parent) {
    ViewHolder holder;
    if (view != null) {
      holder = (ViewHolder) view.getTag();
    } else {
      view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.whatever, parent, false);
      holder = new ViewHolder(view);
      view.setTag(holder);
    }

    holder.name.setText("John Doe");
    // etc...

    return view;
  }

  static class ViewHolder {
    @BindView(R.id.title) TextView name;
    @BindView(R.id.job_title) TextView jobTitle;

    public ViewHolder(View view) {
      ButterKnife.bind(this, view);
    }
  }
}
You can see this implementation in action in the provided sample.

Calls to ButterKnife.bind can be made anywhere you would otherwise put findViewById calls.

Other provided binding APIs:

Bind arbitrary objects using an activity as the view root. If you use a pattern like MVC you can
bind the controller using its activity with ButterKnife.bind(this, activity).
Bind a view's children into fields using ButterKnife.bind(this). If you use <merge> tags in a
layout and inflate in a custom view constructor you can call this immediately after. Alternatively,
custom view types inflated from XML can use it in the onFinishInflate() callback.
VIEW LISTS
You can group multiple views into a List or array.

@BindViews({ R.id.first_name, R.id.middle_name, R.id.last_name })
List<EditText> nameViews;
The apply method allows you to act on all the views in a list at once.

ButterKnife.apply(nameViews, DISABLE);
ButterKnife.apply(nameViews, ENABLED, false);
Action and Setter interfaces allow specifying simple behavior.

static final ButterKnife.Action<View> DISABLE = new ButterKnife.Action<View>() {
  @Override public void apply(View view, int index) {
    view.setEnabled(false);
  }
};
static final ButterKnife.Setter<View, Boolean> ENABLED = new ButterKnife.Setter<View, Boolean>() {
  @Override public void set(View view, Boolean value, int index) {
    view.setEnabled(value);
  }
};
An Android Property can also be used with the apply method.

ButterKnife.apply(nameViews, View.ALPHA, 0.0f);
LISTENER BINDING
Listeners can also automatically be configured onto methods.

@OnClick(R.id.submit)
public void submit(View view) {
  // TODO submit data to server...
}
All arguments to the listener method are optional.

@OnClick(R.id.submit)
public void submit() {
  // TODO submit data to server...
}
Define a specific type and it will automatically be cast.

@OnClick(R.id.submit)
public void sayHi(Button button) {
  button.setText("Hello!");
}
Specify multiple IDs in a single binding for common event handling.

@OnClick({ R.id.door1, R.id.door2, R.id.door3 })
public void pickDoor(DoorView door) {
  if (door.hasPrizeBehind()) {
    Toast.makeText(this, "You win!", LENGTH_SHORT).show();
  } else {
    Toast.makeText(this, "Try again", LENGTH_SHORT).show();
  }
}
Custom views can bind to their own listeners by not specifying an ID.

public class FancyButton extends Button {
  @OnClick
  public void onClick() {
    // TODO do something!
  }
}
BINDING RESET
Fragments have a different view lifecycle than activities. When binding a fragment in onCreateView,
set the views to null in onDestroyView. Butter Knife returns an Unbinder instance when you call bind to do this for you. Call its unbind method in the appropriate lifecycle callback.

public class FancyFragment extends Fragment {
  @BindView(R.id.button1) Button button1;
  @BindView(R.id.button2) Button button2;
  private Unbinder unbinder;

  @Override public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,
  Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    View view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fancy_fragment, container, false);
    unbinder = ButterKnife.bind(this, view);
    // TODO Use fields...
    return view;
  }

  @Override public void onDestroyView() {
    super.onDestroyView();
    unbinder.unbind();
  }
}
OPTIONAL BINDINGS
By default, both @Bind and listener bindings are required. An exception will be thrown if the
target view cannot be found.

To suppress this behavior and create an optional binding, add a @Nullable annotation to fields or
the @Optional annotation to methods.

Note: Any annotation named @Nullable can be used for fields. It is encouraged to use the @Nullable
annotation from Android's "support-annotations" library.

@Nullable @BindView(R.id.might_not_be_there) TextView mightNotBeThere;

@Optional @OnClick(R.id.maybe_missing) void onMaybeMissingClicked() {
  // TODO ...
}
MULTI-METHOD LISTENERS
Method annotations whose corresponding listener has multiple callbacks can be used to bind to any
one of them. Each annotation has a default callback that it binds to. Specify an alternate using
the callback parameter.

@OnItemSelected(R.id.list_view)
void onItemSelected(int position) {
  // TODO ...
}

@OnItemSelected(value = R.id.maybe_missing, callback = NOTHING_SELECTED)
void onNothingSelected() {
  // TODO ...
}
BONUS
Also included are findById methods which simplify code that still has to find views on a View,
Activity, or Dialog. It uses generics to infer the return type and automatically performs the cast.

View view = LayoutInflater.from(context).inflate(R.layout.thing, null);
TextView firstName = ButterKnife.findById(view, R.id.first_name);
TextView lastName = ButterKnife.findById(view, R.id.last_name);
ImageView photo = ButterKnife.findById(view, R.id.photo);
Add a static import for ButterKnife.findById and enjoy even more fun.

Dagger+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Dagger -Antonio Leiva
What is a dependency?
If we want to inject dependencies, we first need to know what a dependency is. In short,
 a dependency is a coupling between two modules of our code (in oriented object languages,
 two classes), usually because one of them uses the other to do something.

        Why dependencies are dangerous?
        Dependencies from high to low level are dangerous because we couple both modules in a way
 that if we need to change one module with another, we necessarily need to modify the code of
 the coupled module. That’s really bad if we want to create a testable app, because unit testing
 requires that when we are testing a module, it is isolated from the rest of modules in our app.
 To do this, we need to substitute dependencies with mocks. Imagine a code like this:

        1
public class Module1{
2
    private Module2 module2;
3

        4
    public Module1(){
        5
        module2 = new Module2();
        6
    }
7

        8
    public void doSomething(){
        9
      ...
        10
        module2.doSomethingElse();
        11
      ...
        12
    }
13
}
How do we test ‘doSomething’ without testing ‘doSomethingElse’? If test fails, what method is the
 one that is failing? We can’t know. And things get worse if this ‘doSomethingElse’ method saves
 something in database or performs an API call.

        Every ‘new’ we write is a hard dependency we probably need to avoid. And no, writing less
 modules isn’t a solution, don’t forget single responsibility principle.

        How to solve it? Dependency inversion
        If we can’t instantiate modules inside another module, we need to provide those modules
 in another way. Can you imagine how? Exactly, via constructor. That is basically what dependency
 inversion principle means. You shouldn’t rely on concrete module objects, only on abstractions.

        Our previous example code would be something like this:

        1
public class Module1{
2
    private Module2 module2;
3

        4
    public Module1(Module2 module2){
        5
        this.module2 = module2
        6
    }
7

        8
    public void doSomething(){
        9
      ...
        10
        module2.doSomethingElse();
        11
      ...
        12
    }
13
}
    So what’s dependency injection?
        You already know! It consists of passing dependencies (inject them) via constructor
 in order to extract the task of creating modules out from other modules. Objects are instantiated
 somewhere else and passed as constructor attributes when creating the current object.

        But here it comes a new problem. If we can’t create modules inside modules, there must
 be a place where those modules are instantiated. Besides, if we need to create modules with
 huge constructors including lots of dependencies, code will become dirty and hard to read,
 with objects travelling around the inmensity of our app. That’s what a dependency injector solves.

        What is a dependency injector?
        We can consider it as another module in our app that is in charge of providing instances
 of the rest of modules and inject their dependencies. That is basically its duty. The creation
 of modules is localized in a single point in our app, and we have full control over it.

        And finally… What is Dagger?
        Dagger is a dependency injector designed for low-end devices. Most dependency injectors
 rely on reflection to create and inject dependencies. Reflection is awesome, but is very time
 consuming on low-end devices, and specially on old android versions. Dagger, however, uses a
 pre-compiler that creates all the classes it needs to work. That way, no reflection is needed.
 Dagger is less powerful than other dependency injectors, but it’s the most efficient.
    Include Dagger
    into your project
        There are two libraries that must be added if you want to use Dagger:

        1
        dependencies{
        2
        compile fileTree(dir:'libs',include:['*.jar'])
        3
        compile'com.squareup.dagger:dagger:1.2.+'
        4
        provided'com.squareup.dagger:dagger-compiler:1.2.+'
        5
        }
        First one is Dagger library.Second library is the dagger compiler.It will create required
 classes in order to be able to inject dependencies.That’s the way it can avoid most reflection,
 by creating precompiled classes.As we only need it to compile the project,and won’t be used by
 application,we mark it as provided so that it isn’t included in final apk.

        Creating your first module
        Modules will be your daily job with dagger,so you need to feel comfortable with them.
 Modules are classes that provide instances of the objects we will need to inject.They are
 defined by annotating the

class with
        @Module.There
        are some
        extra parameters
        that may
        be configured, but I’ll explain when we use them.

        Create a

class called AppModule,that will provide, for example,the Application Context.It’s usually
 interesting to have an easy access to it.I created App,which extends from Application,and
 added to the manifest.

        1
@Module(
        2
        injects= {
        3
        App.class
        4
}
        5
)
6

public class AppModule {
7

        8
    private App app;
9

        10

    public AppModule(App app) {
        11
        this.app = app;
        12
    }
13

        14

    @Provides
    @Singleton
    public Context provideApplicationContext() {
        15
        return app;
        16
    }
17
}
    What is new here?

@Module :identify this

class as a Dagger module.
        injects:Classes where this module is going to inject any of its dependencies.
 We need to specify those classes that are directly injected into object graph.T
 his will be covered soon.
@Provides:Identify method as an injection provider.The name of the method doesn’t matter,it only
 relies on what

class type is provided.
@Singleton :if it’s present,the method will return always the same instance of the object,
 which is far better than regular singletons.If not,everytime this type is injected,we’ll get
 a new instance.In this case,as we are not creating a new instance,but returning an existing
 one,it would be the same if we don’t annotate as singleton,but it explains better what the
 provider is doing.Application instance is unique.

        Why regular singletons are evil
        Singletons are probably the most dangerous dependencies a project can have.First of
 all,because due to the fact that we are not creating an instance,it’s really hard to know where
 we are using it,so these are “hidden dependencies”.On the other way,we have no way to mock them
 for testing or to substitute it with another module,so our code becomes hard to maintain,to
 test and to evolve.Injected singletons,on the other way,have the benefits of a singleton(a unique
 instance)and,as we can create new instances at any moment,it’s easier to mock and to substitute
 with another piece of code,by subclassing or making them implement a common interface.

        We will be creating another module in a new package called domain.It’s quite useful
 to have(at least)a module in every architecture layer.This module will provide an analytics
 manager,that will throw an event when the app starts,only by showing a Toast.In a real project,
 this manager could call any analytics service such as Google Analytics.

        1
@Module(
        2
        complete= false,
        3
        library= true
        4
)
5

public class DomainModule {
6

        7

    @Provides
    @Singleton
    public AnalyticsManager provideAnalyticsManager(Application app) {
        8
        return new AnalyticsManager(app);
        9
    }
10

        11
}
    By identifying this module as not complete,we say that some of the dependencies in this module
 need to be provided by another module.That’s the case of Application,which comes from AppModule.
 When we require this AnalyticsManager from a dependency injection,dagger will use this method,
 and will detect that it needs another dependency,Application,which will be requested to the
 object graph(almost there!).We also need to specify this module as a library,because dagger
 compiler will detect that AnalyticsManager is not been used by itself or its injected classes.
 It’s acting as a library module for AppModule.

        We will specify that AppModule will include this one,so back to previous class:

        1
@Module(
        2
        injects= {
        3
        App.class
        4
},
        5
        includes= {
        6
        DomainModule.class
        7
}
        8
)
9

public class AppModule {
10
        ...
        11
}
    includes attribute
    is there for that purpose.

        Creating the Object Graph
        The object graph is the place where all these dependencies live.The object graph contains
 the created instances and is able to inject them to the objects we add to it.

        In previous examples(AnalyticsManager)we have seen the “classic” dependency injection,
 where injections are passed via constructor.But we have some classes in Android(Application,
 Activity)where we don’t have control over constructor,so we simply need another way to inject
 its dependencies.

        The combination of ObjectGraph creation and this direct injection is represented in
 App class.The main object graph is created in the Application

class and it is injected in order to get its dependencies.

        1

public class App extends Application {
2

        3
    private ObjectGraph objectGraph;
4
    @Inject
    AnalyticsManager analyticsManager;
5

        6

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        7
        super.onCreate();
        8
        objectGraph = ObjectGraph.create(getModules().toArray());
        9
        objectGraph.inject(this);
        10
        analyticsManager.registerAppEnter();
        11
    }
12

        13

    private List<Object> getModules() {
        14
        return Arrays.<Object>asList(new AppModule(this));
        15
    }
16
}
We specify dependencies by annotating them with @Inject. These fields must be public or default
 scoped, so that dagger can assign them. We create an array with our modules (we have only one,
 DomainModule is included in AppModule), and create an ObjectGraph with it. After it, we inject
 App instance manually. After that call, dependencies are injected, so we can call
 AnalyticsManager method.
If you’ve been following this series, you already read about dependency injection basics on part 1
        and Dagger fundamentals on part 2. This last part about Dagger and dependency injection
        Android is focused on scoped object graphs.

        What’s the use of scoped graphs in Dagger?
        When we instantiate Dagger singletons in application object graph, they live in memory until
        the app is destroyed. But there are some singleton dependencies that are useful only when another object is alive. A simple example is a view and its presenter. Most of times you will only use a presenter with an activity at the same time. In MVP, a presenter without a view is useless. We don’t need to keep it in memory after the activity is destroyed.

        How to create a scoped graph?
        It’s easy, we will add it to the application graph. I’m creating a module per activity. So
        let’s see an example in LoginActivity:

        1
@Module(
        2
        injects = LoginActivity.class,
        3
        addsTo = AppModule.class
        4
)
5
public class LoginModule {
6

        7
    private LoginView view;
8

        9
    public LoginModule(LoginView view) {
        10
        this.view = view;
        11
    }
12

        13
    @Provides @Singleton public LoginView provideView() {
        14
        return view;
        15
    }
16

        17
    @Provides @Singleton
18
    public LoginPresenter providePresenter(LoginView loginView, LoginInteractor loginInteractor) {
        19
        return new LoginPresenterImpl(loginView, loginInteractor);
        20
    }
21
}
    This module injects LoginActivity, because it needs to inject the presenter to the activity
        directly, not via constructor. It will be added to AppModule when be create the activity
        graph. Both things must be declared at @Module annotation.

        As you can see, I added a new dependency to LoginPresenter. Its LoginInteractor will
        be injected from a new module called InteractorsModule. It’s a simple and standard module:

        1
@Module(
        2
        library = true
        3
)
4
public class InteractorsModule {
5

        6
    @Provides public FindItemsInteractor provideFindItemsInteractor() {
        7
        return new FindItemsInteractorImpl();
        8
    }
9

        10
    @Provides public LoginInteractor provideLoginInteractor() {
        11
        return new LoginInteractorImpl();
        12
    }
13
}
    Add it to AppModule as you previously did with DomainModule:

        1
@Module(
        2
        injects = {
        3
        App.class
        4
},
        5
        includes = {
        6
        DomainModule.class,
        7
        InteractorsModule.class
        8
}
        9
)
10
public class AppModule {
11
        ...
        12
}
Let’s create the object graph. It will be created by calling plus() to application graph and passing
        new modules. So I created this method in App:

        1
public ObjectGraph createScopedGraph(Object... modules) {
        2
        return objectGraph.plus(modules);
        3
        }
        And now in Activity we inject the presenter instead of instantiating it, create the graph
        and inject the activity:

        1
public class LoginActivity extends Activity implements LoginView, View.OnClickListener {
2

        3
    @Inject LoginPresenter presenter;
4

        5
        ...
        6

        7
    private ObjectGraph activityGraph;
8

        9
    @Override
10
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        11
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        12
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_login);
        13

        14
        ...
        15

        16
        activityGraph = ((App) getApplication()).createScopedGraph(new LoginModule(this));
        17
        activityGraph.inject(this);
        18
    }
