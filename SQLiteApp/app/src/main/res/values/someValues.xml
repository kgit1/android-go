    <!--With layout_weight you can specify a size ratio between multiple views.
    E.g. you have a MapView and a table which should show some additional information to the map.
    The map should use 3/4 of the screen and table should use 1/4 of the screen.
    Then you will set the layout_weight of the map to 3 and the layout_weight of the table to 1.-->
